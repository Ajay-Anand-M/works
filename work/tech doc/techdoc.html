                    MySQL is written in C and C++.
                    Its SQL parser is written in yacc, but it uses a home-brewed lexical analyzer.
                    MySQL works on many system platforms, including AIX, BSDi, FreeBSD, HP-UX, ArcaOS, eComStation, IBM
                    i, IRIX,
                    Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, NetBSD, Novell NetWare,
                    OpenBSD, OpenSolaris, OS/2 Warp, QNX, Oracle Solaris, Symbian,
                    SunOS, SCO OpenServer, SCO UnixWare, Sanos and Tru64.
                    A port of MySQL to OpenVMS also exists.
                </p>
                <p>The MySQL server software itself and the client libraries use dual-licensing distribution.
                    They are offered under GPL version 2, or a proprietary license.

                    Support can be obtained from the official manual.
                    Free support additionally is available in different IRC channels and forums.
                    Oracle offers paid support via its MySQL Enterprise products.
                    They differ in the scope of services and in price. Additionally,
                    a number of third party organisations exist to provide support and services.
                    <br><br>MySQL has received positive reviews, and reviewers noticed it "performs extremely well
                    in the average case"
                    and that the "developer interfaces are there, and the documentation (not to mention
                    feedback in the real world via Web sites and the like) is very, very good".
                    It has also been tested to be a "fast,
                    stable and true multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server"<br>

                </header>
                <p>
                    MySQL was created by a Swedish company, MySQL AB, founded by Swedes David Axmark,
                    Allan Larsson and Finland Swede Michael "Monty" Widenius.
                    Original development of MySQL by Widenius and Axmark began in 1994.
                    The first version of MySQL appeared on 23 May 1995.
                    It was initially created for personal usage from mSQL based on the low-level language ISAM,
                    which the creators considered too slow and inflexible.
                    They created a new SQL interface, while keeping the same API as mSQL.
                    By keeping the API consistent with the mSQL system,
                    many developers were able to use MySQL instead of the (proprietarily licensed)
                    mSQL antecedent.

                <h4><mark>Milestones : </mark></h4>
                <p>Additional milestones in MySQL development included:
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>First internal release on 23 May 1995</li>
                    <li><b>Version 3.19:</b> End of 1996, from www.tcx.se</li>
                    <li><b>Version 3.20:</b> January 1997</li>
                    <li>Windows version was released on 8 January 1998
                        for Windows 95 and NT</li>
                    <li><b>Version 3.21:</b> production release 1998, from www.mysql.com</li>
                    <li><b>Version 3.22:</b> alpha, beta from 1998</li>
                    <li><b>Version 3.23:</b> beta from June 2000,
                        production release 22 January 2001</li>
                    <li><b>Version 4.0:</b> beta from August 2002,
                        production release March 2003 (unions).</li>
                    <li><b>Version 4.1:</b> beta from June 2004, production release October 2004
                        (R-trees and B-trees, subqueries, prepared statements).</li>
                    <li><b>Version 5.0:</b> beta from March 2005, production release October 2005
                        (cursors, stored procedures, triggers, views, XA transactions).
                        The developer of the Federated Storage Engine states that
                        "The Federated Storage Engine is a proof-of-concept storage engine",
                        but the main distributions of MySQL version 5.0 included it and
                        turned it on by default. Documentation of some of
                        the short-comings appears in "MySQL Federated Tables: The Missing Manual".</li>
                    <li>Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL AB in 2008.</li>
                    <li><b>Version 5.1:</b> production release 27 November 2008 (event scheduler,
                        partitioning, plugin API, row-based replication, server log tables)
                        Version 5.1 contained 20 known crashing and wrong result bugs
                        in addition to the 35 present in version 5.0 (almost all fixed
                        as of release 5.1.51).
                        MySQL 5.1 and 6.0-alpha showed poor performance when used
                        for data warehousing – partly due to its inability to
                        utilize multiple CPU cores for processing a single query.</li>
                    <li>Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems on 27 January 2010.</li>
                    <li>The day Oracle announced the purchase of Sun, Michael "Monty" Widenius
                        forked MySQL, launching MariaDB,
                        and took a swath of MySQL developers with him.</li>
                    <li>MySQL Server 5.5 was generally available (as of December 2010).
                        Enhancements and features include:</li>
                </ul>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>The default storage engine is InnoDB, which supports
                        transactions and referential integrity constraints.</li>
                    <li>Improved InnoDB I/O subsystem.</li>
                    <li>Improved SMP support</li>

                    <li>New options for user-defined partitioning.</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>MySQL Server 6.0.11-alpha was announced on 22 May 2009 as the last release of
                        the 6.0 line. Future MySQL Server development uses a New Release Model.
                        Features developed for 6.0 are being incorporated into future releases.</li>
                    <li>The general availability of MySQL 5.6 was announced in February 2013.
                        New features included performance improvements to the query optimizer,
                        higher transactional throughput in InnoDB, new NoSQL-style memcached APIs,
                        improvements to partitioning for querying and managing very large tables,
                        TIMESTAMP column type that correctly stores milliseconds, improvements to replication,
                        and better performance monitoring by expanding the data available through the
                        PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA.[38] The InnoDB storage engine also included
                        support for full-text search and improved group commit performance.</li>
                    <li>The general availability of MySQL 5.7 was announced in October 2015.
                        As of MySQL 5.7.8, August 2015,
                        MySQL supports a native JSON data type defined by RFC 7159.</li>
                    <li>MySQL Server 8.0 was announced in April 2018, including NoSQL Document Store,
                        atomic and crash safe DDL sentences and JSON Extended syntax, new functions,
                        such as JSON table functions, improved sorting, and partial updates. Previous MySQL
                        Server 8.0.0-dmr (Milestone Release) was announced 12 September 2016.</li>
                    <li>MySQL was declared DBMS of the year 2019 from the DB-Engines ranking</li>

                </header>
                <p>
                    MySQL is offered under two different editions: the open source MySQL
                    Community Server and the proprietary Enterprise Server.
                    MySQL Enterprise Server is differentiated by a series of proprietary
                    extensions which install as server plugins, but otherwise shares
                    the version numbering system and is built from the same code base.
                </p>

                <p>The developers release minor updates of the MySQL Server
                    approximately every two months.
                    The sources can be obtained from MySQL's website or
                    from MySQL's GitHub repository, both under the GPL license.
                </p>
                <h4><mark>Limitations : </mark></h4>
                <p>When using some storage engines other than the default of InnoDB,
                    MySQL does not comply with the full SQL standard for some of
                    the implemented functionality, including foreign key references.
                    Check constraints are
                    parsed but ignored by all storage engines before MySQL version 8.0.15.
                </p>
                <p>Up until MySQL 5.7, triggers are limited to one per action / timing,
                    meaning that at most one trigger can be defined to be executed
                    after an INSERT operation, and one before INSERT on the same table.
                    No triggers can be defined on views.
                </p>
                <p>MySQL database's inbuilt functions like UNIX_TIMESTAMP() will return 0
                    after 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038. Recently,[when?]
                    there had been an attempt to
                    solve the problem which had been assigned to the internal queue.
                </p>
                <h4><mark>Deployment : </mark></h4>
                <p>MySQL can be built and installed manually from source code,
                    but it is more commonly installed from a binary package
                    unless special customizations are required.
                    On most Linux distributions, the package management system
                    can download and install MySQL with minimal effort,
                    though further configuration is often required to adjust
                    security and optimization settings.
                </p>
                <p>Though MySQL began as a low-end alternative to more powerful
                    proprietary databases, it has gradually evolved to support
                    higher-scale needs as well. It is still most commonly used
                    in small to medium scale single-server deployments, either
                    as a component in a LAMP-based web application or as a
                    standalone database server. Much of MySQL's appeal originates
                    in its relative simplicity and ease of use, which is enabled
                    by an ecosystem of open source tools such as phpMyAdmin.
                    In the medium range, MySQL can be scaled by deploying it on
                    more powerful hardware, such as a multi-processor
                    server with gigabytes of memory.
                </p>
                <p>There are, however, limits to how far performance can scale on a
                    single server ('scaling up'), so on larger scales, multi-server
                    MySQL ('scaling out') deployments are required to provide
                    improved performance and reliability. A typical high-end
                    configuration can include a powerful master database which
                    handles data write operations and is replicated to multiple
                    slaves that handle all read operations. The master server
                    continually pushes binlog events to connected slaves so
                    in the event of failure a slave can be promoted to become
                    the new master, minimizing downtime. Further improvements
                    in performance can be achieved by caching the results from
                    database queries in memory using memcached, or breaking
                    down a database into smaller chunks called shards
                    which can be spread across a number of distributed server clusters.

                <h4><mark>Graphical user interfaces : </mark></h4>

                <p>
                    A graphical user interface (GUI) is a type of interface that
                    allows users to interact with electronic devices or programs
                    through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary
                    notation, as opposed to text-based interfaces,
                    typed command labels or text navigation.
                </p>

                <p>Third-party proprietary and free graphical administration applications
                    (or "front ends") are available that integrate with MySQL and
                    enable users to work with database structure and data visually.
                </p>
                <h4><mark>MySQL Workbench : </mark></h4>
                <p>MySQL Workbench is the integrated environment for MySQL.
                    It was developed by MySQL AB, and enables users to
                    graphically administer MySQL databases and visually
                    design database structures.
                </p>
                <p>MySQL Workbench is available in three editions, the regular
                    free and open source Community Edition which may be
                    downloaded from the MySQL website, and the proprietary
                    Standard Edition which extends and improves the feature
                    set of the Community Edition, and the MySQL Cluster CGE.

                <h4><mark>Command-line interfaces : </mark></h4>
                <p>A command-line interface is a means of interacting
                    with a computer program where the user issues commands
                    to the program by typing in successive lines of text
                    (command lines). MySQL ships with many command line tools,
                    from which the main interface is the mysql client.

                <p>MySQL Utilities is a set of utilities designed to perform common
                    maintenance and administrative tasks. Originally included as
                    part of the MySQL Workbench, the utilities are a stand-alone
                    download available from Oracle.
                </p>
                <p>Percona Toolkit is a cross-platform toolkit for MySQL, developed
                    in Perl. Percona Toolkit can be used to prove replication
                    is working correctly, fix corrupted data, automate repetitive
                    tasks, and speed up servers. Percona Toolkit is included
                    with several Linux distributions such as CentOS and Debian,
                    and packages are available for Fedora and Ubuntu as well.
                    Percona Toolkit was originally developed as Maatkit,
                    but as of late 2011, Maatkit is no longer developed.

                <p>MySQL shell is a tool for interactive use and administration
                    of the MySQL database. It supports JavaScript, Python or
                    SQL modes and it can be used for administration
                    and access purposes.</p>

                <header>
                    Application Programming Interfaces
                </header>

                <p>
                    Many programming languages with language-specific APIs
                    include libraries for accessing MySQL databases.
                    These include MySQL Connector/Net for .NET/CLI Languages,
                    and the JDBC driver for Java.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition, an ODBC interface called MySQL Connector/ODBC
                    allows additional programming languages that support the
                    ODBC interface to communicate with a MySQL database,
                    such as ASP or ColdFusion. The HTSQL – URL-based query
                    method also ships with a MySQL adapter, allowing direct
                    interaction between a MySQL database and any web client
                    via structured URLs. Other drivers exists for languages
                    like Python or Node.js.

                <p>
                    A variety of MySQL forks exist, including the following.
                </p>
                <h4><u>Current : </u></h4>
                <h5><mark>MariaDB</mark></h5>
                <p>
                    MariaDB is a community-developed fork of the MySQL relational
                    database management system intended to remain free under
                    the GNU GPL. The fork has been led by the original
                    developers of MySQL, who forked it due to concerns
                    over its acquisition by Oracle.
                </p>
                <h5><mark>Percona Server for MySQL</mark></h5>
                <p>Percona Server for MySQL, forked by Percona, aims to retain
                    close compatibility to the official MySQL releases.
                    Also included in Percona Server for MySQL is XtraDB,
                    Percona's fork of the InnoDB Storage Engine.
                </p>
                <h4><u>Abandoned : </u></h4>
                <h5><mark>Drizzle</mark></h5>
                <p>Drizzle was a free software/open source relational database
                    management system (DBMS) that was forked from the
                    now-defunct 6.0 development branch of the MySQL DBMS.
                    Like MySQL, Drizzle had a client/server architecture and uses
                    SQL as its primary command language. Drizzle was distributed
                    under version 2 and 3 of the GNU General Public License (GPL)
                    with portions, including the protocol drivers and replication
                    messaging under the BSD license.
                </p>
                <h5><mark>WebScaleSQL</mark></h5>
                <p>WebScaleSQL was a software branch of MySQL 5.6, and was announced
                    on 27 March 2014 by Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and Twitter as
                    a joint effort to provide a centralized development structure
                    for extending MySQL with new features specific to its
                    large-scale deployments, such as building large replicated
                    databases running on server farms. Thus, WebScaleSQL opened
                    a path toward deduplicating the efforts each company had been
                    putting into maintaining its own branch of MySQL, and toward
                    bringing together more developers. By combining the efforts
                    of these companies and incorporating various changes and
                    new features into MySQL, WebScaleSQL aimed at supporting
                    the deployment of MySQL in large-scale environments.
                    The project's source code is licensed under version
                    2 of the GNU General Public License, and is hosted on GitHub.

                <h5><mark>OurDelta</mark></h5>
                <p>The OurDelta distribution, created by the Australian company
                    Open Query (later acquired by Catalyst IT Australia), had
                    two versions: 5.0, which was based on MySQL, and 5.1,
                    which was based on MariaDB. It included patches developed
                    by Open Query and by other notable members of the MySQL
                    community including Jeremy Cole and Google. Once the patches
                    were incorporated into the MariaDB mainline, OurDelta's
                    objectives were achieved and OurDelta passed on its build
                    and packaging toolchain to Monty Program (now MariaDB Corp).
